Getting Started
Prerequisites

A modern web browser (e.g., Chrome, Firefox, Edge).
An active internet connection for API requests.
API keys for OpenWeatherMap and Unsplash (optional for custom keys, as demo keys are included).

Installation

Clone the Repository:
git clone https://github.com/your-username/wander-explorer.git
cd wander-explorer


Get API Keys (Optional):

OpenWeatherMap: Sign up at openweathermap.org to get a free API key. Replace the demo key in index.html (line ~330) with your own:const OPENWEATHER_API_KEY = 'your-openweather-api-key';


Unsplash: Sign up at unsplash.com/developers for a free API key (50 requests/hour in demo mode). Replace the demo key in index.html (line ~328):const UNSPLASH_ACCESS_KEY = 'your-unsplash-access-key';



Note: The included demo keys work for testing but have rate limits. Using your own keys is recommended for production or heavy usage.

Serve the Application:

Since this is a static HTML file with client-side JavaScript, you need a local server to handle API requests (due to CORS restrictions).
Option 1: Use a local development server like live-server:npm install -g live-server
live-server


Option 2: Use Python‚Äôs HTTP server:python3 -m http.server 8000


Open your browser and navigate to http://localhost:8000 (or the port provided by the server).


Explore:

Enter a city name in the search bar (e.g., ‚ÄúParis‚Äù or ‚ÄúTokyo‚Äù) and press ‚ÄúExplore Now‚Äù or hit Enter.
View destination cards, click to see details in a modal, or remove destinations as needed.



File Structure
wander-explorer/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ index.html         # Main HTML file with embedded CSS and JavaScript
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ README.md          # Project documentation (this file)

Usage

Search for a Destination:

Type a city name in the search bar and click ‚ÄúExplore Now‚Äù or press Enter.
The app fetches weather data, a main image, and a gallery of related images, displaying them in a card.


Interact with Cards:

Hover over a card for a smooth scale and shadow effect.
Click a card to open a modal with a gallery and summary.
Click the √ó button on a card to remove it from your list.


Manage Destinations:

Use the ‚ÄúClear All‚Äù button to remove all saved destinations (with a confirmation prompt).
Destinations are saved in the browser‚Äôs localStorage for persistence.


View on Mobile:

The layout adjusts automatically for smaller screens, with a stacked search bar and single-column grid.

Limitations

API Rate Limits: The demo Unsplash key is limited to 50 requests/hour, and the OpenWeatherMap key has usage restrictions. Use personal API keys for extended use.
Security: API keys are hardcoded in the client-side JavaScript, which is not suitable for production. Consider a backend proxy for secure key management.
Image Fallback: If Unsplash returns no images, a default image is used, which may not always be relevant.
Accessibility: Some elements (e.g., gradient text) may need contrast improvements for accessibility.

Future Improvements

Backend Integration: Move API keys to a server-side proxy (e.g., Node.js/Express or Flask) for security.
Caching: Store API responses in localStorage to reduce redundant calls and handle rate limits.
Debouncing: Add debouncing to the search input to prevent rapid API requests.
Sorting/Filtering: Allow users to sort destinations by temperature or name, or filter by country.
Accessibility: Enhance ARIA attributes and text contrast for better accessibility.
Offline Support: Implement a service worker to cache static assets for offline access.
